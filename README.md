## 📊 Datase

The project utilizes two primary datases:

1. **store.csv*: Contains information about different stores, includig:
   - **Store ID*: Unique identifier for each stoe.
   - **Type*: Categorical variable indicating the type of stoe.
   - **Size*: The physical size of the stoe.

2. **train.csv*: Includes historical sales data with features such s:
   - **Store ID*: Reference to the stoe.
   - **Date*: The date of the sales recod.
   - **Weekly Sales*: Sales figures for the given wek.
   - **Holiday Flag*: Indicator of whether the week includes a holidy.
   - **Temperature*: Average temperature for the wek.
   - **Fuel Price*: Cost of fuel during the wek.
   - **CPI*: Consumer Price Indx.
   - **Unemployment*: Unemployment rate during the wek.

## 🚀 Installation

### 1️⃣ Clone the repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/27abhishek27/Sales-Department-Project.git
cd Sales-Department-Project
```

### 2️⃣ Install dependencies:

Ensure you have the following Python packages installed:

- `pandas`
- `numpy`

- `seaborn`
- `scikit-learn`

You can install them using pip:

```bash
pip install pandas numpy matplotlib seaborn scikit-learn
```

## 🔍 Methodology

### 1. **Data Preprocessing**

- **Handling Missing Value**: Identified and addressed any missing data in the dataets.
- **Feature Engineerin**: Created new features to better capture temporal patterns, such as extracting month and year from the `Date` feld.
- **Data Mergin**: Combined `store.csv` and `train.csv` datasets based on `Store ID` to consolidate informaion.

### 2. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**

- **Sales Trends Analysi**: Examined sales patterns over time to identify seasonal effects and trnds.
- **Impact of Holiday**: Analyzed how holidays influence weekly sales figres.
- **Correlation Analysi**: Explored relationships between sales and external factors like `Temperature`, `Fuel Price`, `CPI`, and `Unemploymnt`.

### 3. **Predictive Modeling**

- **Sales Forecastin**: Developed regression models to predict future sales based on historical data and external variales.
- **Model Evaluatio**: Assessed model performance using metrics such as Mean Absolute Error (MAE) and Root Mean Squared Error (RSE).
